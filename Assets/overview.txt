Step-by-Step Guide to Implementing a Constraint-Based Soft-Body System for Meshes in Unity

1. **Setup Unity Project**
    - Open Unity and create a new 3D project.
    - Import any necessary assets or create a simple mesh to work with.

2. **Create Soft-Body Script**
    - Create a new C# script named `SoftBody.cs` and attach it to your mesh object.

3. **Define Soft-Body Structure**
    - In `SoftBody.cs`, define the structure for the soft-body system, including vertices, constraints, and physics properties.
